[VoiceXML](https://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20) (VXML) is designed for creating audio dialogs that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative conversations.

This experimental project aims to integrate VoiceXML with JSX.
